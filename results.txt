Analysis:
Performance decreased after certain threads due to overhead.

In the DAXPY experiment, the execution time increased when the number of threads was increased from 2 to 4. This happened due to thread creation overhead and limited CPU cores in Google Colab.

In matrix multiplication, a small speedup was observed with 4 threads because the workload was better distributed among threads. However, the improvement was limited by memory access and system constraints.

In the calculation of π, almost no speedup was observed. This is because the overhead of parallelization was comparable to the computation time.

Overall, maximum speedup was achieved at a lower number of threads. Increasing threads beyond this point resulted in performance degradation
due to synchronization cost, context switching, and limited hardware resources.
